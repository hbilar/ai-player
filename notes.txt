Over the last couple of days, collected images from Mario, and trained tensorflow on the different images.
The model comes out highly accurate, but each image takes about 5500ms to classify - ouch!

Will try to use mobilenet for tensorflow instead, to see if we can trade some accuracy for a lot of speed.

With mobilenet trained on a 128x128px image, with 25 neurons per hidden layer, image labelling takes about 140ms.
The neural net is about 1.0Mb in size, compared to 83Mb for the default imageNet

With 224x224px and 100 neurons, classification takes about 560ms, and the graph ends up at 13Mb.

Sprite list downloaded from http://www.mariomayhem.com/downloads/sprites/super_mario_bros_sprites.php

Started writing create_training_data.py, which will use the screenshots I've saved from the level and insert random enemies into them, and save the image + the label data for the image (to use as a training set).

Generated a sample xml using https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg, to use as a template for the training generation program.

Further work on create_training_image. Now generating the screenshots and XML files successfully.
